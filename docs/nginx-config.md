# Nginx Configuration and Explanation

```bash

#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
```

Here’s what each of these directives and location blocks do:

- listen — Defines what port Nginx will listen on. In this case, it will listen on port `80`, the default port for HTTP.
- root — Defines the document root where the files served by this website are stored.
- index — Defines in which order Nginx will prioritize index files for this website. It is a common practice to list `index.html` files with a higher precedence than `index.php` files to allow for quickly setting up a maintenance landing page in PHP applications. You can adjust these settings to better suit your application needs.
- server_name — Defines which domain names and/or IP addresses this server block should respond for. **Point this directive to your server’s domain name or public IP address**.
- location / — The first location block includes a `try_files` directive, which checks for the existence of files or directories matching a URI request. If Nginx cannot find the appropriate resource, it will return a 404 error.
- location ~ \.php$ — This location block handles the actual PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the fastcgi-php.conf configuration file and the `php7.4-fpm.sock file`, which declares what socket is associated with `php-fpm`.
- location ~ /\.ht — The last location block deals with `.htaccess` files, which Nginx does not process. By adding the deny all directive, if any .htaccess files happen to find their way into the document root ,they will not be served to visitors.
